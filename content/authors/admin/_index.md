I'am now a student of the Program of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Zhejiang University, minoring in ​Intensive Training Program of the Chu Kochen Honors College. My research interests include AI for science like physical simulation, deep learning for large-scale graph and Explainable AI. I'm highly-motivated to pursue a PhD in Computer Science at Golden States since Golden State Warriors (an American professional basketball team) are based in San Francisco.
